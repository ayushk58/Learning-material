AUTHENTICATION

In simple words authentication could be understood as if the person is who he is claiming to be in order to access the permissions given to a person/user defining what he could and what he could not to do.

 There are three authentication factors into which different types of authentication can be categorized:

1. Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes referred to as "knowledge factors".
2. Something you have, that is, a physical object like a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes referred to as "possession factors".
3. Something you are or do, for example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes referred to as "inherence factors"
